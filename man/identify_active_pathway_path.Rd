\usage{
identify_active_pathway_path(pathway.path, processed.query.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathway.path}{A list with pathway path data where each sublist denotes a path of the pathway. This is used as background data.}

\item{processed.query.data}{A list with expressed query data where each sublist corresponds for each cell/tissue type.}
}
\value{
This function returns a list of pathways where each sublist denote a path of the pathway.
}
\description{
This function identifies active pathway paths for RNA-seq gene expression profile. It utilizes background pathway path data to identify the active pathway paths.
}
\details{
This function identifies active pathway paths for RNA-seq gene expression profile. It utilizes background pathway path data to identify the active pathway paths.

\examples{
## Here we will use "pathway.path" as background data from the SPAGI repository.
## Also we will use "ROR1.data" as query RNA-seq gene expression data. This data is for ocular lens epithelial cell differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells.
## These data sets are loaded automatically with the package.


comb.ppi.result <- combine_mm_hs_ppi(mm.ppi, hs.ppi, RP.protein, KN.protein, TF.protein)
# Generate the pathway path data using the comb.ppi.result and housekeeping.gene data sets
new_background_paths <- generate_pathway_path(ppi.result = comb.ppi.result, housekeeping.gene, num_paths = 1)


## Pre-process the query data (ROR1.data), the data has already been made in CPM and log2 normalized format. Also we have already made the replicate names same for the data.
ROR1.processed.data <- preprocess_querydata(cell.tissue.data = ROR1.data, exp.cutoff.th = 1.8)
## Identify active pathway paths of the processed query data
ROR1.active.pathway <- identify_active_pathway_path(pathway.path = new_background_paths, processed.query.data = ROR1.processed.data)
head(ROR1.active.pathway$ROR1_LEC$FGFR1)
}
